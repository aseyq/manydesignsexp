<br>
<p>
  In The Decision Stage <strong>you will be offered the opportunity to take away a percentage (from 0 to 100%) of the group 
  {% if session.config.competition %}
    competitors' 
  {% else %}
    members'
  {% endif %}
  earnings</strong>.</p>
<p>
 After the decision stage one participant in the group will be selected randomly and the choice of the selected member will be implemented. Participants will not know which memberâ€™s choice is implemented, but they will see the final outcome in the feedback stage.
</p>

<p>
  If your decision will be implemented, the amount taken away from other 
  {% if session.config.competition %}
    competitors'
  {% else %}
    members'
  {% endif %}
 earnings will be subtracted to their final earnings and will be added to your final earning.
