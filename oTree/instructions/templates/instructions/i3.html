<ul>
  <li><strong>Stage 1</strong>: In <strong>the effort stage</strong>, you will solve a task which would allow you to collect some money. The money you collected may or may not be included in your final earnings from this experiment based on your or 
    {% if session.config.competition %}
      your competitors’
    {% else %}
      other group members’
    {% endif %}
    decisions.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Stage 2</strong>: In <strong>the decision stage</strong>, you and
    {% if session.config.competition %}
      your competitors
    {% else %}
      other group members
    {% endif %}
    will decide whether to take some part of the collected money from
    {% if session.config.competition %}
      your competitors in the group.
    {% else %}
      other group  members.
    {% endif %}
  </li>

  <li><strong>Stage 3</strong>: In <strong>the feedback stage</strong>, you will see the earnings
    {% if session.config.competition %}
      and the ranking of you and your competitors.
    {% else %}
      of you and other group members.
    {% endif %}
  </li>
</ul>
<p>    In the following few pages, we will explain the details and the potential earnings from these stages. </p>
